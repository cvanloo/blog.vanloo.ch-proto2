(section The good parts

Because of its high price, I would not have bought the reMarkable if it were not for the 30-day money-back guarantee.
After a week of daily usage, returning it was the last thing on my mind.

Consistent with their advertised claims, it really feels like writing on real paper.
The reMarkable is handy, light-weight, and has lots of storage for my notes.
No more difficult to search through piles of paper up to the ceiling.
Tagging notebooks and single pages within a notebook makes them easily discoverable.

(subsection It runs Linux

I did not want to end on a negative note, so I kept the best part for last:
The reMarkable runs on Linux \(which makes total sense if you think about it\).

When plugged into a computer, the reMarkable automatically opens an SSH port.
It takes a bit of rummaging through settings to find the IP address\(es\) and root password.

(title My review of the :reMarkable)

(tags reMarkable review technology proprietary)

(brief
The :reMarkable is a paper tablet that advertises note taking without any distractions.
Its high price point certainly makes one think twice before buying.
Pros: quality, battery for weeks, feels like writing on real paper, open access to underlying Linux system, intuitive interface, tags.
Cons: disposable tips (have to buy refills), subscription service, pencil breaks easily when dropped, bad touch recognition in the corners/borders, proprietary file format, vendor lock-in (not a safe space for your notes!).

I did not want to end on a negative note, so I kept the best part for last:
The :reMarkable runs on Linux (which makes total sense if you (sidenote (t easier to extend, needs few resources, does not deplete battery quickly) think about it)).
When plugged into a computer, the :reMarkable automatically opens an SSH port.
It takes a bit of rummaging through settings to find the IP address(es) and root password.

To make things simpler, I recommend setting up an SSH config...

(code (file ~/.ssh/config) \+
host remarkable
	Hostname 10.11.99.1
	User root
\+)

...and copy over your pubkey:

(code ~$ ssh-copy-id)

I use this to backup my data:

(code \+
~$ mkdir -p "backup-`+"`"+`date +%F`+"`"+`/files" && cd $_ && cd ..
~$ scp remarkable:~/.config/remarkable/xochitl.conf . # backup config
~$ scp remarkable:/usr/bin/xochitl                    # backup binary
~$ rsync -avAX remarkable:~/.local/share/remarkable/xochitl/ files/ # backup files
\+)

(q \+
Backups are for wimps. Real men upload their data to an FTP site and have everyone else mirror it.
